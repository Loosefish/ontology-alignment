973|The thymus gland is part of the immune system.  It is composed of lymphoid tissue and epithelial cells. It consists of two irregularly shaped lobes united by a connective tissue capsule. Each lobe is subdivided by connective tissue septa into lobules, which consist of an inner medullary zone, continuous with the medullae of adjacent lobules, and an outer cortical zone. The cortex is rich in lymphocytes (thymocytes) and the medulla in epithelial cells. This gland is supplied by the inferior thyroid and internal thoracic arteries, and its nerves are derived from the vagus and sympathetic nerves. The thymus is the site of T-lymphocyte production, necessary in early life for the normal development of immunological function. The thymus reaches its greatest relative weight shortly after birth and its greatest absolute weight and maximal development at puberty. It then begins to involute resulting in a slow decline of immune function throughout adulthood.

3111|Muscle Spindle
3109|The Muscle Spindle is composed of intrafusal fibers that are located within and run parallel to the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscle. When the extrafusal fibers are stretched, the intrafusal fibers of the spindle stretch as well. When stretching occurs, the sensory neuron from the muscle spindle signals the motor neurons located within the ventral horn of the spinal cord. This signal causes the motor neurons to fire, resulting in contraction of the muscle. This reflex arc provides negative feedback. The muscular contraction induced by the stretching works against or negates further muscle stretch. This mechanism helps to maintain proper muscle tension or tone. Although the muscle spindle helps to maintain proper muscle tension, unlike the Golgi tendon organ, it is not an indicator of muscle tension, but rather of muscle length.

3191|Hypothalamus is an important supervisory center in the brain, rich in ganglia, nerve fibers, and synaptic connections. It is composed of several sections called nuclei, each of which controls a specific function. The hypothalamus regulates body temperature, blood pressure, heartbeat, metabolism of fats and carbohydrates, and sugar levels in the blood. Through direct attachment to the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus also meters secretions controlling water balance and milk production in the female. The role of the hypothalamus in awareness of pleasure and pain is well established in the laboratory. It is involved in the expression of emotions, such as fear and rage, and in sexual behaviors. Despite its numerous vital functions, the hypothalamus in humans accounts for only 1/300 of total brain weight, and is about the size of an almond. Structurally, it is joined to the thalamus; the two work together to monitor the sleep-wake cycle.

It is composed of a dorsal stratum of closely spaced pigmented cells, the pars compacta, and a larger ventral region of widely scattered cells, the pars reticulata. The pars compacta includes numerous cells that project forward to the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and contain dopamine, which acts as the primary neurotransmitter at the synaptic endings. Other, apparently non-dopaminergic cells project to portions of the ventral nucleus of thalamus, the superior colliculus and reticular formation. The nigrostriatal projection is reciprocated by a striatonigral fiber system with multiple neurotransmitters, chief among which is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

4793|A columnar-shaped cell found in the epithelium of the lobular bronchiole. Each cell contains 200-300 cilia 5-8 mm long. The cilia are part of the mucociliary system, which extends through the tracheobronchial tree and into the respiratory bronchioles. This system protects the respiratory surface from dirt and airborne infection and represents the principal mechanism of defense in the respiratory tract. The cilia beat in unison (about 1,000 strokes per minute) and in a wave-like fashion, thereby propelling mucus and entrapped foreign material toward the oropharynx for expectoration or swallowing.

Its cytokines contribute to recruitment of infiltrating cells, progression of injury, and sustenance of fibrogenesis.

Crypts of Lieberkuhn are moat-like invaginations of the epithelium around the villi that extend through the lamina propria down to the muscularis mucosae. Lymphocytes often invade the epithelium or form solitary lymphoid nodules in the lamina propria. Lymph nodules may form longitudinal aggregations of 30-50 nodules in the lamina propria of the ileum. These large aggregations are called Peyer's patches. The muscularis mucosae has two layers and extends into the intestinal villi, where the smooth muscle cells form a longitudinal bundle in the centre of the villi.

1203|The pancreas is an organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is the shape of a fish and about the size of a hand.  It is a compound gland composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues.  The endocrine pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy. The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food.  Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known. (from Diabetes Dictionary: http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/dictionary)

The receptors are transmembrane proteins which bind to the molecules and ions that give rise to the 5 taste sensations. Although a single taste cell may have representatives of several types of receptor, one type may be more active than the others, but no single taste cell contains receptors for both bitter and sweet tastants. Each taste receptor cell is connected to a sensory neuron leading back to the brain. The supporting cell has microvilli and appears to secrete substances into lumen of taste bud.

During the first half of pregnancy, the epithelium undergoes considerable growth leading to the formation of new terminal branches of ducts and of alveoli. The mammary glands continue to grow during the second half of pregnancy due to increases in the height of epithelial cells and an expansion of the lumen of the alveoli.

1727|A cuboidal cell derived from a spindle-shaped granulosa cell precursor. Initially, ovarian granulosa cells create a single layer surrounding an oocyte. The oocyte and its single layer of ovarian granulosa cells make up a primary follicle. Proliferation of the ovarian granulosa cells leads to multiple cell layers surrounding the oocyte and maturation into a secondary follicle. The granulosa cells extend cytoplasmic processes to form gestational gap-junction-like unions with the plasma membrane of the oocyte. The continued growth of the ovarian granulosa cells takes the oocyte to the Graafian follicle stage. Once ovulation occurs, the granulosa cells become part of the corpus luteum. A major function of an ovarian granulosa cell is hormone production and secretion.

3035|The Golgi Tendon Organ is located within the tendons found on each end of a muscle. It responds to increased muscle tension or contraction as exerted on the tendon, by inhibiting further muscle contraction, which protects against muscle damage. The proprioceptive sensory neuron of a Golgi tendon organ, projects to the motor neurons located within the ventral horn of the spinal cord, where the inhibition occurs. Unlike the muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organs do not indicate muscle length, but rather muscle tension.

4131|Free Nerve Ending
4132|Free nerve endings are widely distributed throughout the body, and are found as branches of unmyelinated, or lightly myelinated fibres grouped in bundles beneath the epithelium. As they penetrate the epithelium, they lose their myelin, and branch among the epithelial cells. Branches of one nerve may cover a wide area and overlap the territories of other nerves. The free nerve endings detect pain, touch, pressure and temperature, and are associated with C fibres.
